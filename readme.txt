MonsterMash.js

Playing with vanilla JS in an effort to learn.

Basic concepts:

-Monsters (more like robots) are made of 6 parts: head, torso, 2 arms, and 2 legs.
-Parts are created/drawn individually and then combined to make a complete monster.
-Monsters fight eachother with the quicker one hitting first.
-Add other stuff to explore more JS functionality.

ToDo:
-Add more stuff...and learn!
-Create a GUI...or dont and wait until I feel like using Angular/jQuery so that I don't waste 5 hours and kill a cat.
-Clean up code.
